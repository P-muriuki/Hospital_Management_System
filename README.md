# GOAL
1. Create a program that manages patients information.
The program should be able to:
a. Collect user information.
b. Store user information.
c. Find user information when given a name to search.

2. Test the program using unit tests.

3. Create APIs for the program for it's web development.

4. Have a visually appealling dashboard from simulated data to show user information.
Another might even show the distribution of patients based on the information given.

As of now this is a progression toward building the program that is why it is incomplete.
